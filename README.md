# Design & Implementation of AI-Powered Website for Tracking Student & Faculty Achievements
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Design & Implementation of AI-Powered Website for Tracking Student & Faculty Achievements project!

This project is designed to create a website that tracks student and faculty achievements through the use of artificial intelligence. The website will allow students and faculty to track their progress and accomplishments in real-time, as well as providing analytics and data on their achievements.

## Project Description
The main objective of this project is to design and implement a website that will help students and faculty to track their achievements in real-time. The website will use AI algorithms to analyze and track various metrics, such as attendance, performance in assignments, quizzes, and exams, and extra-curricular activities.

The website will have two user types: students and faculty. Each user type will have a different set of features and functionalities. Students will be able to view their own achievements and progress, set goals for themselves, and receive personalized recommendations for improvement. Faculty members, on the other hand, will have access to data analytics and will be able to view the achievements and progress of all students in their courses.

## Features
The following are some of the main features of the website:

- User authentication and authorization
- Student profile creation and management
- Faculty profile creation and management
- Achievement tracking for both students and faculty
- Real-time data analytics and reporting
- Personalized recommendations for improvement
- Course management for faculty
- Integration with external tools and platforms
- Technologies Used

-> React.js for the frontend
-> Node.js for the backend
-> MongoDB for the database
-> TensorFlow for the AI algorithms
-> Contributing
